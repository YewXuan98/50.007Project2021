Now, based on the training and development set, think of a better design for developing an im- proved sentiment analysis
system for tweets using any model you like. Please explain clearly the model/method that you used for designing the new
system. We will check your code and may call you for an interview if we have questions about your code. Please run your
system on the development set RU/dev.in and ES/dev.in. Write your outputs to RU/dev.p4.out and ES/dev.p4.out. Report the
precision, recall and F scores of your new systems for these two languages.
(10 points)
We will evaluate your systemâ€™s performance on two held out testsets RU/test.in and ES/test.in. The test sets will only
be released on 48 hours before the deadline. Use your new system to generate the outputs. Write your outputs to RU/test.p4.out
and ES/test.p4.out.
The system that achieves the overall highest F score on the test sets will be announced as the winner.
